**Automating a simple slide with overengineered code**

---

## **Project Overview**

This project explores the ironic complexity of automating the creation of a single Google Slide using the Google Slides API. While the task at hand seems simple, the journey demonstrates how overengineering can turn a straightforward problem into a fun, learning experience. The slide itself is programmatically generated, showcasing the power (and complexity) of automation.

## **Why This Project?**

As an integrations engineer, I often tackle tasks that involve automating workflows between different systems. This project is a playful example of how even the simplest tasks can evolve into elaborate processes when approached with automation. It serves as both an exploration of the Google Slides API and a humorous reflection on the engineer’s tendency to overcomplicate.

## **How to Run the Project**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/overengineering-a-slide.git
   cd overengineering-a-slide
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Google API Setup**:
   - Set up a Google Cloud project and enable the Google Slides API.
   - Download OAuth credentials and save them as `credentials.json` in the root directory.

4. **Run the Script**:
   After setting up the credentials, you can run the script that generates the Google Slide presentation:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```
